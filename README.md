# Halimedes: The Crawling Curiosity

Welcome to Halimedes—an expressive, crawling robot with an attitude, a personality, and now… **functional eye contact**. This isn't just a Pi project. This is a living thing. Sort of. Don’t get weird about it.

## What Is This?

Halimedes is a four-legged Raspberry Pi–powered crawler bot that can:

- Track and follow human faces with smooth, accurate eye movement
- Respond with voice, actions, and expressions
- Use LLM-generated responses with embedded sound and action tags
- Recognize who he's talking to and adjust tone accordingly
- Remember (eventually) what you told him, and probably use it against you

## Features

- **Face tracking:** Realtime eye-gaze tracking using PiCamera and Vilib
- **Voiceprint recognition:** Different prompts for Dad, Unknowns, and more
- **Emotion-aware sound system:** Reacts with custom SFX based on emotion or intent
- **LLM-powered dialogue:** Modular responses with embedded `<action>`, `<sound effect>`, `<gaze>`, and `<face>` tags
- **Smooth animation:** Blinks, saccades, and expressions driven by a unified `EyeAnimator` engine
- **Upcoming:** Memory embedding + recall, weather & news display, servo-driven scanning for lost faces, and LED-based flashlight system because lasers are a lawsuit waiting to happen

## Setup

> *Documentation incoming. For now, assume there's blood, zip ties, and more Python modules than you'd expect.*

## Philosophy

Build it modular. Build it weird. Make it real enough to make the dog nervous.
